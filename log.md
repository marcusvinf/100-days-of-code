# Plan to learn Java, node.js, p5, html, css, python, and some hacking.



# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 11, 2018 (Example 1)


**Today's Progress**: Started Java, and learned some basics

**Thoughts:** Was really getting into it, thus it lead me to make a very shitty calculator, but one that helped me to learn few basic syntaxes.



### Day 2: June 12, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Learn more syntax, build some string projects

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
